      <p>
        If you no longer wish to use BoxLead and want all your data permanently
        removed from our systems, follow the steps below. This process ensures
        complete erasure of your Leads, Conversations, and Messages from our
        database.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Remove BoxLead from Facebook</h2>
      <p>
        First, revoke BoxLead's access to your Facebook account by removing the
        integration:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Go to <strong>Facebook Settings</strong> &rarr;{" "}
          <strong>Security and Login</strong> &rarr;{" "}
          <strong>Business Integrations</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Find <strong>BoxLead</strong> in the list of active integrations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click <strong>Remove</strong> to disconnect BoxLead from your Facebook
          account.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This immediately stops BoxLead from receiving any new messages or data
        from your connected Facebook Pages and Instagram accounts.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Request Data Erasure</h2>
      <p>
        After removing the integration, send an email to our support team to
        request full deletion of your stored data:
      </p>
      <div className="legal-contact">
        <p>
          <strong>Email:</strong>{" "}
          <a href="mailto:support@boxlead.io">support@boxlead.io</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Subject:</strong> Data Deletion Request
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Include:</strong> Your BoxLead Account ID (found in your
          account settings) and the email address associated with your account.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Step 3: Confirmation</h2>
      <p>
        Once we receive your request, we will permanently delete the following
        data from our PostgreSQL database within <strong>30 days</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All <strong>Leads</strong> associated with your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          All <strong>Conversations</strong> and their message history.
        </li>
        <li>
          All <strong>Messages</strong> (both inbound and outbound) stored on
          your behalf.
        </li>
        <li>Your account profile and connected integration tokens.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You will receive an email confirmation once the deletion is complete.
      </p>
